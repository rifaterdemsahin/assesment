# Antigravity Session Log

## Actions Taken
- **Fixed `index.html`**: Appended missing React rendering logic and closing tags.
- **Enhanced `index.html`**: Added `html2pdf.js` and a "Download PDF" button for assessment reports.
- **Created `video_script.md`**: Drafted a 60-second comedy/memory palace script for the project video.
- **Created `n8n_workflow.json`**: Designed a workflow to intake assessment data via webhook.
- **Verified**: Checked `index.html` rendering and button placement (via browser tool and code review).

## Next Steps
- Record the video using the script.
- Import the n8n workflow.
- Deploy the updated `index.html`.
