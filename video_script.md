**"First, the Engine Check. We scan the chassis—Security, Culture, CI/CD. No guessing."**

**"The diagnostic tells us exactly what's broken. 'Oil leak in Security?' We fix it."**

**"Then, Upgrades. We don't just lecture; we install new parts. MLSecOps tires. AIOps suspension."**

**"This isn't random. It's engineered. The Assessment guides the Training. The Training prepares the vehicle for the real test."**
