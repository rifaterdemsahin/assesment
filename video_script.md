## 📝 Summary of Links (The "Fun" Logic)
1.  **Dungeon (Problem)** ➡️ **Map (Assessment)**: You can't escape without knowing where you are.
2.  **Map (Report)** ➡️ **Armory (Training)**: The map tells you what monsters are out there, so you grab the right weapons.
3.  **Armory (Skills)** ➡️ **Construction (Delivery)**: Once you have weapons and skills, you go build the kingdom (and I'm the Master Builder).
