# Project Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)

## Vision
To empower organizations to assess and elevate their DevOps maturity through the lens of Artificial Intelligence, providing actionable insights and a clear roadmap for transformation.

## Objectives

### 1. Assess and Benchmark DevOps Maturity
**Goal:** Provide a standardized framework for evaluating DevOps practices across key domains (CI/CD, Infrastructure, Observability, Security, Culture, Automation) with a specific focus on AI integration.
*   **Key Result 1:** Successfully categorize users into one of four maturity levels: AI Aware, AI Experimenting, AI Integrated, or AI Native.
*   **Key Result 2:** Cover 6 critical categories with 4 targeted questions each to ensure comprehensive coverage.

### 2. Deliver Actionable Intelligence
**Goal:** Move beyond simple scoring to provide concrete, actionable recommendations that users can implement to improve their standing.
*   **Key Result 1:** Generate a tailored "Transformation Roadmap" for every assessment, broken down into 3 phases (Foundation, Integration, Optimization).
*   **Key Result 2:** Provide specific "Recommended Reports & Actions" based on low-scoring areas (e.g., "AI-Powered CI/CD Transformation Guide" for low CI scores).

### 3. Showcase AI Integration and Innovation
**Goal:** Demonstrate the value of AI not just in the content, but in the delivery of the assessment itself.
*   **Key Result 1:** Enable seamless integration with n8n for AI-powered PDF report generation.
*   **Key Result 2:** Utilize a modern, responsive, and interactive UI (React + Tailwind) to reflect the "AI-First" nature of the assessment.

### 4. Lead Generation and Business Growth
**Goal:** Use the assessment tool as a lead magnet to identify organizations ready for DevOps transformation services.
*   **Key Result 1:** Capture user details (Name, Organization, Role, Email) before starting the assessment.
*   **Key Result 2:** Identify "Critical" and "High" priority areas in user reports to tailor follow-up consulting proposals.

## Technical Goals
*   **Performance:** Ensure the assessment loads instantly and runs smoothly in the browser (Client-side React).
*   **Portability:** Maintain a single-file or minimal-build structure for easy hosting (GitHub Pages).
*   **Extensibility:** Keep the question bank and scoring logic modular for easy updates.
